**Customer Emotion Analysis**

The Customer Emotion Analysis System is a sentiment and topic analysis tool that extracts emotions, topics, and sentiment scores from customer feedback. This project utilizes NLP models, including RoBERTa for emotion detection, TextBlob for sentiment scoring, and spaCy for topic extraction. The system also computes an Adorescore, which reflects customer sentiment intensity based on the extracted topics and emotions.

# Problem Statement 

In todayâ€™s competitive market, understanding customer emotions is vital for improving products, services, and customer satisfaction. Traditional sentiment analysis methods only capture polarity (positive, neutral, negative) but fail to detect the depth and diversity of emotions within customer feedback. Businesses lack tools that provide actionable emotional insights in real-time across different industries and languages.

# Abstract

This project presents a Customer Emotion Analysis System that uses advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze customer feedback and extract multiple emotional states. The system classifies emotions with confidence scores and activation levels (High, Medium, Low), identifies the intensity of each emotion, and is adaptable across industries such as e-commerce, healthcare, finance, etc.

The core objective is to help businesses better understand customer sentiments beyond simple polarity and take meaningful actions based on emotional cues derived from real-time feedback.
