**Customer Emotion Analysis**

The Customer Emotion Analysis System is a sentiment and topic analysis tool that extracts emotions, topics, and sentiment scores from customer feedback. This project utilizes NLP models, including RoBERTa for emotion detection, TextBlob for sentiment scoring, and spaCy for topic extraction. The system also computes an Adorescore, which reflects customer sentiment intensity based on the extracted topics and emotions.
